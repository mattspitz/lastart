Given a regular expression from which you can get the album's artist and
name from the full path of a given directory, lastart will pull a cover
image and save it as a particular filename in that directory.  Go fill in
all of those missing covers you've got!

Usage:
./lastart.py [-f art_filename] album_dir

art_filename defaults to 'cover.jpg'

Hint, try:
find /path/to/all/music -type d -exec ./lastart.py {} \;
